# Kainoa Island
Kainoa Island is a reality-based, 3D environment roleplay-sandbox for all ages, featured on the Roblox platform. Here, you can roleplay as any profession - police officer, restaurant chef, robber, firefighter, etc. - and engage with other players by using the Roleplay Stories menu to find role-playing sessions. You can also unleash your imagination with the power of our advanced build editor and create anything from your dream house to a restaurant. There's no limit in our virtual world. Our experience also features an unlimited avatar editor, a large variety of tools and items in the toolbox, a catalog of vehicles (cars, air-vehicles, boats, bikes, buses, and motorcycles), an immersive house/building editor, and a large community of creators for you to collaborate with and contribute to.
